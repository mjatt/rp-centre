# Contributing

We are happy to accept/review pull requests, but please follow the below guidlines to reduce the review process.

* Please make sure your editor is set to a tabSize of 2 to make sure he syntax of the project is consistant (eslint will also scream at you if you dont).
* Run `npm run lint` _or_ `npm run lint-autofix` this will run eslint. Please make sure this passes before raising your pull request. If this fails wercker will not let the branch be merged into master.
* If you could resolve your own conflicts that would be fab, however I'm happy to help if needed.

Thats it, nothing too hard just makes our lives easier.
