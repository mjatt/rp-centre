      "description" : "\nSESA has had their first successful satellite launch today, with a pair of SIEN I satellites (known as SIEN-1 and SIEN-2 respectfully [Surface Inspecting Engagement Noticer]) aboard the Tähílios III rocket system. The launch was from the Stahnian SpacePort, off of launch pad IX. The Tähílios III rocket system is the latest iteration of a geostationary capable launch vehicle to come out of the Mātkāxidi Program. “The successful launch of the twin SIEN satellites has demonstrated the capabilities of this new rocket system,” Director Korhën had to say. “With the completion of this rocket system, the program is nearing completion of its goal. The next and final step of the program is to create a capsule capable of withstanding the rigors of spaceflight with human personale. We already have several designs for such a capsule.” \n \nTähílios III rocket:\n\nThe Tähílios III rocket is the fifth rocket developed for the program, the first rocket (the Próetevin rocket) was scrapped due to its limited launch capabilities with large amounts of cargo. The Tähílios III rocket has incorporated superior engine design and stage separation lessons from the previous iterations. The specs of the rocket are government secrets, however the general specs have been released. The rocket has a 7,900 kg capacity to take to geostationary orbit, and a 22,500 kg capacity for low earth orbit operations. The rocket operates on two stage method (a base stage and a payload stage). \n\nSIEN satellites:\n\nThe SIEN satellites, developed by the Stahnian government in conjunction with Stahnian Communication and Imaging industrial tech specialists, are to be the first of several satellites in a new Suez Satellite Constellation. The Constellation, while not a purely military operation, falls under the command of the Stahnian National Defense force, underneath Operation Rauta. The purpose of the Constellation is for the prevention of any and all threats to the canal area, in the form of invasion by land or sea. While the satellite specs are top secret, the general details have been released. Each satellite is equipped with two main cameras, one for wide range general viewage, and one for localized viewing, a small series of solar cells and panels, a fairly large battery, a series of computers and several small thrusters. The satellite weighs a total of 2300 kgs.\nHow the system works in total is that the WRVC (Wide Range Viewing Camera) surveys the large areas under the satellite’s jurisdiction, and if it sees if there is anything which might be a threat. If there is something which seems to be a threat, the attached computer flags it, and the satellite activates and the (Small Range Viewing Camera) SRVC looks over the flagged area. Every flag sends a notification to the ground teams, however if the SRVC’s attached computer believes it to be a threat an alarm is sounded for the ground teams. The ground teams spread the word to whatever necessary military divisions. The WRVC can survey an area of 100 miles and the SRVC can survey and area of  here. The lifespan of the satellites, once fully operational, is estimated to be approximately eight years.\n \n“The events which lead to the global war with which we are now engaged in have opened my eyes to the need for this Constellation,” Ruler Käddiåston had to say of the events. “The unprovoked invasion by the Afriki could have been dealt with, or even stopped, had we had the information these satellites will be giving us on a moment by moment basis. This investment in spaceflight will pay back itself ‘hundredfold.” The launched satellites have been stationed around the border of Afrikia with Surrelis, and the border of Ehormon with Al Berbestan. (SIEN-1 and SIEN-2 respectively). The Stahnia will quickly add to the constellation as vehicles can be manufactured.\n",

He had worked to democratize the oligarchic republican government, pushed for and funded rural development, and smoothed out the rocky relations between the Gallish and Mayian Parliaments stabilizing the union and calming down separatists. The nation grieves over the great loss of such an important man in its history. \n\nNow comes the Issue of His Majesties succession. He had left his throne to his eldest child Franziska Kiefer. Despite this, there are many who claim she is not eligible for the throne because of her late mother's lack of noble heritage.Queen Aleksandra Ilves-Kiefer was born into a family of wealthy Mayain politicians from Riga who (although powerful) did not have any trace of noble blood.\nTherefore, one of the claimants of the throne is her own brother Julius Kiefer whose mother (The current queen) Queen Diana Rosenfeld-Kiefer comes from a lineage of powerful dukes whose noble bloodline dates back to the first conquests of Jutland in 1374. \n\nDespite the grief felt across the nation, this has already sparked intense debate amongst the nobility and within the parliaments.",

In Grafenland, people will be allowed to keep their money, their whole earned money! Nobody has the right to rob them of their money, not even the government. We also want to make our country more attractive to young and creative entrepreneurs.\nOn the other hand, we will not pay any subsidies to companies. Free market also means free of subsidies. This is an important topic and I want to make this clear.\"\n\nYears ago, Grafenland abolished many consumption taxes, such as tobacco tax, alcohol tax, mineral oil tax and many more. Every citizen in Grafenland currently pays only a flat income tax of 9%, the companies now only 2.5% company tax.\nGrafenland continues the course of the consequent \"minimum state\".",

Behind him, were 42 other men and women... Their mission: To infiltrate the palace and capture the Queen. If this all worked out, the entire Queedom of Botswana would fall, and in its place, would rise, [nation]Zacnov[/nation].  His walkie-talkie roared with static.  He picked it up, and held it to his ear.  [b]\"*Static* We are in, positi*Static*. Over.[/b]  The colonel spoke into the device. \"We await your signal, comrades... Over.\"  3 minutes had passed until they heard an explosion at the other side of the palace.  \"The Queen! Move, move!\" One of the royal guards in the area yelled before he ran toward the gate to open it.  He signalled to another guardsman at the top, the gate started to open.  \"Together, comrades! For the Confederacy!\" Sanders yelled at his men.  His reply, a thunderous primal yell of approval. Causing a few of the guardsmen to run off in fear.  They sprang from the bushes, surprising the Royalist scum. Gun fire could be heard in the quiet of night as the rebels brought doom upon the Royalist scum.  \"Federalists, die!\"  \"Death to the monarchy!\"  \"Freedom!\"  \"For the Queen!\"  All these, and snippets of other war slogans, could be heard alongside the gun fire. Chaos reigned in the inky blackness of the night... The only form of light coming from the erratic pulses of gun fire.  \"Enough, comrades! If we truly want to be free, we must nip away our oppressers right in the bud! Forward, to the palace!\" Sanders yelled as the guards on top realized what was going on.  He took a few pot shots at the gears of the gate, forcing the gate to obey gravity.  This caused the other rebel Federalists and him to roar their approval. They then quickly moved into the palace. As they marched into the palace, artillery rounds could be heard from elsewhere in the city as the rest of the Federalist army mobilized into the capitol. ---------- Max moved his left foot down on the driver.  The tank stopped.  \"Comrades, something is not right...\"  \"Commander?\" The main gunner asked.  \"I see the Royalists, retreating from the palace!\"  \"What is so wrong about that, commander?\" Asked the driver.  \"Why would they abandon the Queen so easily? These are men who owe her their social standing and life! Something is amiss...\"  As Max said this, a tiny little limousine drove past the tank.   And in an instant, Max's sparp eyes picked up something... The Queen's face!  \"Comrades, follow that limousine!\"  He lifted off his left foot, and planted his right foot back onto the driver. The engine roared into action.  The gun spun about, its gun arching closer, and closer toward the limo.  [I]BOOM![/I]  The back of the tank exploded, sending the engine on fire...  Comradess, run!\" Someone yelled.  [I]BOOM![/I]  Another explosion. This time, the main gun was dented in its back.  Max just barely escaped... His grey uniform now filled with black smudges and red stains.  [I]The Federalists, they need to know![/I] Max thought as he attempted to catch his breath from his sudden sprint...  Fortunately for Max, the secondary gunner's body had taken much of the second round's impact, leaving him rather unscathed.  He looked around at his surroundings. [I]I lost her![/I]  ---------- \"Comrades! She has escaped!\"  \"How!?\" Sanders asked out loud.  The soldier who said that just shook his head.  The colonel started to ground his teeth in anger...",
